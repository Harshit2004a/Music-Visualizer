# Electrified Audio Visualizer
This is a real-time music visualization project that transforms audio signals into a dynamic, electrified waveform. Using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SoundDevice, this visualizer captures live audio, processes its frequency components, and displays an animated waveform with an electric-style effect.

## Features:
1. Real-Time Audio Processing – Captures live audio input and analyzes frequency components using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

2. Electrified Line Effect – The visualized waveform flickers and shifts colors, simulating an electric current.

3. Dynamic Color Shifts – The waveform randomly cycles between neon colors for a vibrant, energetic feel.

4. Smooth Animation – The visualization updates rapidly with a smoothing effect for fluid motion.

5. Frequency-Based Movement – The line moves in response to different frequency bands, highlighting changes in bass, mids, and treble.

## Technology Stack:
1. Python (core programming)

2. NumPy (FFT and frequency analysis)

3. Matplotlib (visualization and animation)

4. SoundDevice (real-time audio input handling)

## How It Works:
- Captures live audio through the microphone.

- Computes the FFT to analyze the frequency spectrum.

- Maps frequency magnitudes to the waveform's movement.

- Applies smoothing and jitter effects to create an electric-style look.

- Continuously updates with fast animation and color variations.

This project is ideal for music lovers, audio enthusiasts, and creative coders looking to explore real-time audio visualization with Python.
